# StopTheLightFPGA
Mimics the cyclone arcade game where it spits out jackpot tickets if you stop the light when its right on top of you.

The UCF and BIT files are configured for the BASYS 2 Spartan series FPGA boards.

I am trying to locate the block and state diagrams I did when I started this project. I think it I still have it, but if it is lost then I might have to redo it sometime in the future.
